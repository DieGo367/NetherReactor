FINDINGS

Blocks and Structure
	[X] Blocks in regions above main room are preserved
		(outside of the ones that get replaced by the spire)
		In other words, the structure does not replace blocks with air, except for in the main room

	[X] Glowing obsidian placement occurs regardless of what block is present
		Will work if blocks are left as is
		Will work if blocks are mined
		Will work if blocks are mined and replaced with something else
	[X] Glowing obsidian placement steps are precise
		(only the blocks that visually change in a step are placed, there is no overlap with previously placed glowing obsidian)
	[X] Glowing obsidian is never replaced after mining it
		(except by the obsidian during the reactor cooldown)

	Confirmed the bottom two layers of netherrack never decay
	Confirmed only the walls of the spire decay
	[X] Any non-netherrack blocks placed in the spire walls will also decay
	[X] Spire walls do not decay in full rectangles. Only blocks that the spire itself occupied/replaced are decayed
	[X] Decay chance for a block is 25%


	Confirmed core powers down on decay step
	[X] Obsidian is placed again on decay step
	
	[X] Obsidian powerdown moves downwards from the top layer
	Confirmed powerdown steps to be 860, 880, 900, and deactivation at 920

Items
	[X] The actual summon times for items are [200,260,400,440,500,600,680,720,760,800]
	[X] The actual loot table is ["Red Mushroom", "Brown Mushroom", "Cactus", "Nether Quartz", "Pumpkin Seeds", "Sugar Canes", "Glowstone Dust", "Melon Seeds"]

	[X] Glowstone Dust always drops as a stack of 3
	[X] Nether Quartz always drops as a stack of 4
	[X] All other items are a single drop

	[X] Items spawn between radii of 3 and 7 blocks away from the reactor core

	Confirmed loot drops are equal weight per item
	Confirmed exactly 15 spawns occur during first three waves

	[X] During the remaining waves, 0 is the minimum drop, with 37 as a maximum, excluding the outlier of 71
		It may be reasonable to go with double the avg rate for these as a maximum
		Averages are [15, 15, 15, 17.32, 20.68, 16.14, 10.32, 11.44, 17.92, 9.9]

Pigmen
	Confirmed will never spawn past 3 Pigmen
	Confirmed will only spawn at most two at a time
	
	[X] Pigmen will only spawn during the first half of spawn waves [200,260,400,440,500]
	[X] At times 440 and 500, only 1 Pigman will spawn at max, despite two being spawnable
	
	[X] Follow the same spawn radius rules as items

	[X] Don't agro instantly, instead will agro if close enough to player (within 4 blocks)
